Powershell scripts to automate transcoding and authoring DVDs

## My use case
We are recording live video with Wirecast to .mov files (MJPEG codec).

We needed a way to automate the conversion of those recordings to Ready-to-burn DVD files (VIDEO_TS), complete with automatic chapters and menus.

These scripts run with one click.
